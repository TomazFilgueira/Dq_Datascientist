    "# 1) Distribution Window Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The last lesson of the SQL window functions course delves into **distribution or statistical window functions**, which provide insights into data distribution and are used chiefly for statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution window functions have diverse applications across various domains, including marketing, finance, healthcare, sports, and education. They allow data analysts to gain valuable insights from data and make data-driven decisions. For example, these functions can help marketers identify the top-performing products, campaigns, or customers based on their sales or engagement metrics, allowing them to optimize their marketing strategy. Also, they can be used for calculating the percentiles of medical data such as blood pressure, BMI, or cholesterol levels, helping physicians or researchers diagnose diseases or assess the health status of patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll cover two types of distribution window functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Rank distribution** functions are used to calculate the relative rank of a specific row in a window partition based on the ordering specified in the `OVER()` clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * `PERCENT_RANK()`\n",
    "\n",
    "    * `CUME_DIST()`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inverse distribution** functions are used to calculate the value at a specified percentile in a group based on the ordering specified in the WITHIN GROUP() clause.\n",

    "# 2) The Rank Distribution Functions - CUME_DIST()\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, two variants of rank distribution functions exist: `CUME_DIST()` and `PERCENT_RANK()`. They compute a row's relative rank in the window partition and return a ratio between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The CUME_DIST() Function**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `CUME_DIST()` function, which takes no argument, calculates the cumulative distribution of values in a column specified in the `ORDER BY` subclause. In other words, assuming the data is sorted in **ascending order**, the cumulative distribution of a value in a particular row is determined as the number of rows with values less than or equal to that value divided by the number of rows existing in the window partition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax of the `CUME_DIST()` function is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CUME_DIST() OVER ( [PARTITION BY expression, ... ]\n",
    "                   ORDER BY expression [ASC | DESC], ... )\n",

Since the set has seven values, the median falls at the fourth rank, which means that 50% of the values are below rank four, and 50% are above rank four.\n",

So the median of this list is `23`, which is an interpolated value between the two middle values.\n",
