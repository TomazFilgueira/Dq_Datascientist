    "\n",
    "Authentication is key to confirming identity and safeguarding sensitive data within APIs. Understanding the need for authentication is crucial for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Protection: It ensures sensitive information remains secure.\n",
    "1. Rate Limiting: Authentication enables APIs to impose specific usage limits based on the user's identity.\n",
    "1. User Management: It allows APIs to deliver personalized data and responses to individual users.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several common methods of authentication in APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. API keys: Simple yet effective unique identifiers for verifying users or applications.\n",
    "1. OAuth: A more complex, secure protocol for granting access.\n",
    "1. Basic Auth: This involves sending username and password credentials, encoded in Base64, via the HTTP header.\n",
    "1. Token authentication: Involves issuing a token after login, which is then used in subsequent request headers for authentication."

    "# 2) Navigating API Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "This documentation is designed to be your comprehensive guide to navigating our API side server, which utilizes content from the World Development Indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our API offers a comprehensive guide to effectively utilizing its features. Here's what we need to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Base URL:** The primary access point for the API is https://api-server.dataquest.io/economic_data. This URL serves as the foundation to which endpoint paths are appended. For private tables, we will use https://api-server.dataquest.io/private/economic_data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Endpoints:** The API provides various endpoints, such as /indicators, /countries, /historical_data, /footnote, /country_series, and /series_time. These endpoints represent different data resources accessible through the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **HTTP Methods:** Our API primarily responds to GET requests, allowing users to retrieve data from the specified endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parameters:** Parameters like limit, offset, field, filter_by, sort_by, and sort_desc can be used to refine data retrieval, offering control over the quantity, pagination, and sorting of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Response Formats:** The API delivers responses as JSON-formatted strings, specifically as lists of dictionaries enclosed in quotes. To convert these strings into usable list formats in Python, you can use json.loads(). This approach ensures that the data is both user-friendly and easily parsed for practical utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Rate Limits:** Most APIs impose limits on the number of requests you can make in a certain timeframe to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Error Messages:** Our API is designed to handle various error scenarios effectively, providing clear messages to aid in troubleshooting. Here are some potential error cases and their corresponding messages:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Authentication Errors: If a request to a private endpoint lacks proper authentication, the API responds with \"Unauthorized\" or \"Invalid authentication credentials\". This occurs when the 'Authorization' header is missing, incorrect, or if the provided credentials do not match our records.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Database and Table Validation: When a request is made for a non-existent database or table, the API raises a \"Selected database does not exist\" or \"Selected table does not exist\" error. This ensures users are querying valid data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Invalid Query Parameters: If query parameters like field, filter_by, or sort_by contain values not present in the database schema, the API responds with \"Invalid [parameter] parameter, please ensure that only fields available in schema are specified.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Filter Syntax Errors: Incorrect filter syntax, particularly with comparators, triggers a \"Incorrect filter comparator, please use one of the following: =, !=, ~\" error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Access Violations: Attempts to access private data without proper authorization, or using the public API for private data, result in \"Not authorized\" or \"Please use public API to retrieve data from a public source\" messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * General Exceptions: For other unforeseen errors, the API provides a generic \"Unknown error occurred\" message. This is a catch-all response for exceptions not explicitly handled by the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Authentication:** Access to private endpoints requires authentication, which is supported through **two methods**: `basic authentication` and `token-based authentication`. For basic authentication, use the header Authorization: `Basic` . For token-based authentication, use Authorization: `Bearer` ."

    "# 4) Enviroment Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "We learned that, in Basic Authentication, **credentials are encoded** and sent in the request headers. This method is more secure compared to directly using API keys in the code, but it still poses a risk if the credentials are exposed.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how do we protect our credentials in a Basic Authentication scenario? The answer lies in using **environment variables**.\n",
    "\n",
    "An environment variable is a dynamic \"object\" containing a value that can be used by one or more software programs in an operating system. You can think of them as secret lockers in your computer where you can keep important information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we use the os module to set and get environment variables. Here's how you can **set** an environment variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "    import os\n",
    "\n",
    "    os.environ['USERNAME'] = 'your-username'\n",

    "\n",
    "    username = os.environ.get('USERNAME')\n",
    "    password = os.environ.get('PASSWORD')\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, storing your Basic Authentication credentials in a **separate configuration file** is another secure approach. This is useful when managing multiple credentials or configurations. Your Python script can read these credentials as needed, keeping them out of your main codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, your credentials.json file might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"username\": \"your-username\",\n",
    "        \"password\": \"your-password\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "And in your Python script, you could use:\n",
    "\n",
    "    import json\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Reading credentials from a file\n",
    "    with open('credentials.json', 'r') as file:\n",
    "        credentials = json.load(file)\n",
    "        username = credentials['username']\n",
    "        password = credentials['password']\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider some risks associated with exposed credentials in Basic Authentication:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unauthorized Access**: Exposed credentials can lead to unauthorized access to APIs, potentially leading to data breaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Manipulation**: If someone else gets hold of your credentials, they could manipulate the data you are accessing or modifying through the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Service Abuse**: Misuse of your credentials could result in the abuse of the API services, affecting your application's functionality and possibly incurring additional costs.\n",

    "# 5) Troubleshooting: Handling Authentication Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with APIs, it's important to handle situations where authentication fails. These failures are usually indicated by specific HTTP status codes, part of the HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) response sent by servers to indicate the status of a web request.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common HTTP status codes related to authentication errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "`400 Bad Request`: This status code indicates that the request sent to the server was incorrect or corrupted and the server couldn't understand it. It often points to issues such as improperly formatted request syntax, invalid request message parameters, or deceptive request routing.\n",
    "\n",
    "`401 Unauthorized`: This means the request lacks valid authentication credentials for the target resource. In other words, our API key was invalid, and we've been denied access.\n",
    "\n",
    "`403 Forbidden`: This means the server understood the request, but it refuses to authorize it. This status is similar to 401 (Unauthorized), but indicates that the client must authenticate itself to get the requested response.\n",
    "\n",
    "`429 Too Many Requests`: This means the user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time (\"rate limiting\"). In this case, we've exceeded our quota and need to slow down.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we can elegantly handle these errors using a `try/except` block. This approach allows us to catch the error and respond appropriately, rather than having the entire program crash. Here's an example of how this can be implemented:\n"

    " API quotas and rate limit are mechanisms implemented to manage server resources, ensure fair usage among all users, and prevent the API from being overwhelmed by too many requests\n",
    "\n",
    "**API Quotas** are defined as the maximum number of requests allowed over a specific period, like per minute, hour, or day. For example, an API might limit you to 1000 requests per day. Exceeding this quota means your additional requests within the same day will be denied. This is similar to a public library limiting the total number of books you can borrow at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "**API Rate Limits**, on the other hand, restrict the number of requests you can make in a given timeframe. This is similar to the library's policy on how often you can renew your borrowed books. For instance, an API might have a rate limit of 100 requests per hour. If you send 101 requests within one hour, the last request will be denied.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you exceed an API's quota or rate limit, the server typically responds with a `429 Too Many Requests` HTTP status code. This is a clear signal to pause your requests for a while, much like a library flagging your account when you've exceeded your renewal limit.\n",

    "\n",
    "To ensure we don't exceed the rate limit, we need to manage the timing of our requests effectively. One way to do this is by using the `time.sleep()` function in Python. This function pauses the execution of the program for a specified number of seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we're working with an API that has a rate limit of `100` requests per minute. To stay within this limit, we could add a delay of 0.6 seconds (60 seconds / 100) between each request. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "import requests\n",
    "import time\n",

    "Timing our requests in this way is especially crucial when we're dealing with large-scale data retrieval tasks. For example, if we need to retrieve data for thousands of indicators from the World Development Indicators API, we'll likely need to make thousands of requests. By adding a delay between each request, we can ensure that we don't exceed the API's rate limit.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Social Media Analysis**: If you're building a sentiment analysis tool that uses a social media company's API to gather posts, you'll be making a large number of requests.

    "# 8) Dealing with Rate Limit\n",
    "\n",
    "In our data retrieval journey, we've learned to authenticate our requests using Basic Authentication, time our requests to avoid exceeding rate limits, and handle various potential errors. But what if we still hit the rate limit? Does this mean our data retrieval process has to stop? Not necessarily!\n",
    "\n",
    "When we exceed the rate limit, the API server responds with a `429 Too Many Requests` status code. Instead of letting this error halt our data retrieval, we can catch this error, pause our script temporarily, and then continue with our requests. This approach respects the API's rate limit while ensuring our data retrieval continues.\n",

Notice that we're pausing for 0.6 seconds between each request to respect the API's rate limit of `100` requests per minute. However, we're sending 101 requests in this example to intentionally exceed the rate limit and demonstrate how we can handle the `429 Too Many Requests` status code.\n",

    "When we hit the rate limit, the server responds with a `429` status code. We catch this status code using an if condition and pause our script for 60 seconds before continuing with our requests. This pause allows us to stay within the API's rate limit while ensuring the continuity of our data retrieval process.\n",
