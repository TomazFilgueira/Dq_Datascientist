# 📊 Exploring Financial Data Using the Nasdaq Data Link API  
*Guided Project — Financial Analysis with Python*

#📝 1. Introduction

This project explores financial analysis using the **Nasdaq Data Link API**, a powerful service that provides access to a wide range of financial datasets.  
The analysis focuses on the **MER/F1 datatable**, which includes detailed company fundamentals such as:

## 🎯 Project Goal

The main objective of this project is to extract and analyze financial data for a selected set of companies, with a particular emphasis on **understanding their financial performance over time**.

A key metric explored throughout this project is:

### **Accrued Expenses Turnover**

This indicator is an important financial efficiency ratio that measures how frequently a company pays off its accrued expenses during a period. It provides insight into several aspects of financial and operational health:

- **Cash Flow Management:**  
  A higher ratio suggests efficient short-term cash management and stronger liquidity.

- **Operational Efficiency:**  
  Companies that settle short-term obligations promptly tend to exhibit better operational discipline.

- **Financial Health Indicator:**  
  Consistent payment of accrued expenses reflects financial stability and supports better creditworthiness and supplier relationships.
